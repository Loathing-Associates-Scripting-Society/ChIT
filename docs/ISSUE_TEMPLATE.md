## ChIT Settings Changes

Describe any changes you've made to your ChIT settings here. If you don't remember if you have, try `prefref chit.` in
KoLMafia's Graphical CLI (the "." is important) and note any settings that do not start with "DEFAULT:"

# Expected/Desired Behavior

Please describe the behavior you are expecting.
If the bug or feature involves a particular challenge path, item, quest, etc, please state that.

Please note that if the request involves a particular item that I do not own, it will be necessary
for you to test the change yourself and report back here if it worked or not, as I will have no way
of testing the change myself, beyond the point of not causing ChIT to fail to run without it.

# Current Behavior

What is the current behavior?

# Screenshot(s)

If reporting unusual or otherwise flawed behavior, please include a screenshot (or multiple screenshots, if relevant).
It would be preferred if you attached the screenshot directly to this issue.
